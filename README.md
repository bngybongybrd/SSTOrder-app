# SSTOrder

SSTOrder is an app made by SST students for SST. This app allows students and staff to order food from the canteen or cafe online, so as to shorten the queueing times of ordering food. The app is also usable by the stall vendors to view their operational data, such as their daily earnings, so as to increase operational efficiency and reduce food wastage.
